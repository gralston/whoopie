<H1>Jonathan Wexler's Game</H1>

In the mid 1960's, Jonathan Wexler (JW) a computer scientist at the State University of New York, at Buffalo, invented a new 
card game he whimsically called, "Whoopie".

Here's a <a href=/static/whoopie.pdf>link</a> to the original whoopie rules JW shared with my father, Tony Ralston (TR).

That's all I got for now!
