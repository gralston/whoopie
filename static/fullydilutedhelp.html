<title>Angelcalc Help: Fully Diluted Shares</title>
</head>
<body class="legal">


Fully diluted shares means all shares of issued stock (common and preferred),
issued options or warrants and unissued options which have been reserved in the stock option pool.
Naturally, this includes all founder shares, vested and unvested.
<p></p>
In other words, this is the total number of outstanding shares assuming everything is either vested,
granted or converted to common stock.  Also note, this number does include the number of unissued
options you enter in the next field to the right.
