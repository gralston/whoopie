</span><sup class="c25"><a href="#ftnt1" id="ftnt_ref1">[1]</a></sup></p><p class="c2 c20 c16"><span class="c5 c25"></span></p><p class="c2 c16"><span class="c5 c9">Introduction</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c4">Whoopie is a card game that may be played with varying numbers of players. New players may be added during a game and exiting players may drop out without ending the game. The rules are divided into four sections. The new Whoopie player need concern himself only with Section I - General Introduction. Section II defines correct procedure in some of the more unusual situations and Section III enumerates violations of the Spirit of Whoopie. &nbsp;Section IV provides a brief introduction to the Sanctioning Authority and Associated System.</span></p><p class="c2 c20 c27"><span class="c5 c4"></span></p><p class="c2 c16"><span class="c5 c9">Section I - General Introduction</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c7">Players</span><span class="c5 c4">: From three to ten may participate at a single table.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c7">Deck</span><span class="c5 c4">: The standard 52 card deck plus two jokers is used.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c15">Rank of Cards in suits and between suits</span><span class="c15">: </span><span class="c5 c4">All suits have equal rank. Within a suit the cards rank as Ace (highest) K Q J 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 (lowest).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c7">Scorekeeper and First Dealer</span><span class="c5 c4">: The players initially cut cards to determine relative ranking. The highest ranking player becomes scorekeeper; the lowest ranking player becomes the First Dealer. For the purposes of determining rankings or breaking ties, a joker ranks above an ace. If a tie for a position occurs the players so tied continue to draw cards until the tie is broken among themselves. &nbsp;For example, if three players A,B,C were tied for high by each drawing a queen, and if A and B next draw 8&#39;s while C draws a 6, then Aand B are still tied and C is deemed to be in third place; A and B draw again until one of these two draws a higher card, whereupon he becomes the highest ranking player. An analogous procedure holds if there is a tie for low; in the preceding example if A, B, C were tied for low, then after the second draw C would be low man.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c7">Stanza</span><span class="c4">: A stanza is composed of the following actions. First, the deck is shuffled by the dealer and cut by the player on his right. The dealer then deals cards face down, one by one, to consecutive players, clockwise, beginning with the player at his left, until each player has N cards. The dealer then turns up the top card of the undealt portion of the deck. This card is called the </span><span class="c4 c7">Whoopie Defining Card</span><span class="c4">. The players then declare or bid, in clockwise order, beginning with the player at dealer&#39;s left, the exact number of tricks they intend to take. When bidding is completed the player at dealer&rsquo;s left leads a card and the play proceeds. The player winning a trick leads to the next trick. At end of the stanza the scorekeeper inquires of each player whether or not he made his bid and updates the player&rsquo;s score appropriately.</span></p><p class="c2 c12"><span class="c5 c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c7">First Dealer and subsequent deals</span><span class="c5 c4">: The First Dealer will deal one card to each player. After the first stanza, and subsequently, the deal passes to the dealer&#39;s left. On the second stanza two cards will be dealt to each player, etc. up to the maximum number of cards that can be dealt to each player while still leaving an undealt card that can become the Whoopie Defining Card. The number of cards then decreases one by one thru successive stanzas until only one card is again dealt to each player, and this cycling may be repeated indefinitely. The same number of cards may not be dealt to a player on two successive stanzas.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c7">Bidding</span><span class="c4">:</span><span class="c5 c4">&nbsp;The players, starting with the player at dealer&#39;s left and proceeding clockwise, announce or &quot;bid&quot; the number of tricks they intend to take in the play. The dealer, who makes the last bid, must choose a bid so the total number of tricks contracted does not equal the total number of possible tricks.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c7">Scoring</span><span class="c5 c4">: If a player contracts to take a specified number of tricks and does exactly this, he will score 2 plus the number he bid. If a player takes more or fewer tricks than he bid, he loses 1 point from his score.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c7">Play</span><span class="c5 c4">: After the bidding is completed the player at dealer&#39;s left leads to the first trick. Atrick comprises one card from each player. The player winning the current trick leads to the next trick.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c4">When a player leads a suit the other players must, if possible, follow suit. If unable to follow suit a player may play any card from his hand. The highest card played in the suit led will win the trick, unless a trump is played, in which case the highest trump played will win, or when equally high trumps are played (e.g. two Aces of trumps) the first one played wins the trick.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c7">Trumps and Whoopie cards</span><span class="c5 c4">: The Whoopie Defining Card defines the first trump suit and the denomination of Whoopie cards for this stanza, e.g. If the Jack of Diamonds was turned up as the Whoopie Defining Card then Jacks would be Whoopie cards and diamonds would be the current trump suit.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Trump is changed when the Whoopie card of another suit is played and immediately changes trump to that suit. </span><span class="c22">Note: this change is not retroactive</span><span class="c5 c4">; previously played cards in the new trump suit do not count as trumps, and cards played as trumps previously on the trick still count as trumps.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c4">A player playing a Whoopie card must audibly say &quot;Whoopie&quot; before the next player plays a card or (penalty) he loses one point from his score for not calling &quot;Whoopie.&quot;</span></p><p class="c26"><span class="c5 c4">For example, suppose the Jack of Diamonds was the Whoopie Defining Card and suppose diamonds were still trump when player A leads the King of Spades. &nbsp;Suppose player B puts on the 8 of diamonds (i.e. 8 of trumps), player C plays the Jack of Hearts (Whoopie - now hearts are trump - and the Jack (of trump) is higher than the 8 (of trump)), player D plays the Jack of Spades (he Whoopies trump into Spades - but player C is still winning the trick since his was the first Jack of trumps, and the King of Spades, when played by player A, was not a trump), player E plays the Queen of Spades (i.e. first Queen of trumps), player F plays the Jack of Clubs (clubs are now trump), and finally player G follows suit with the Ace of Spades. Player E will win the trick with his Queen of trumps and lead to the next trick - where clubs will start off as trump.</span></p><p class="c2 c20"><span class="c5 c13"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c5">Jokers: A joker has the same denomination as the Whoopie Cards and is considered a trump when played to any trick.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c4">When a joker is played to a trick (i.e. not a lead) it cancels the current trump suit and the J-Trump condition prevails; cards played after the joker, in the suit originally led to this trick, are now considered trumps.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c4">In J-Trump condition, when a player wins a trick, the suit he leads to the next trick becomes trump for that trick - or until changed by a Whoopie card.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c4">J-Trump condition remains on subsequent tricks until altered into a suit by the play of a Whoopie card.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c4">When a player leads a joker, the current trump suit is cancelled, J-Trump condition prevails, except that for this trick all suits count as trump (i.e. the first highest card played will win the trick). If a Whoopie card is played on this trick, trump changes to that suit (cancelling J-Trump), but if the other joker is played on this trick after the Whoopie, all suits again become trump for the remainder of this trick only, and J-Trump prevails again (unless re-Whoopied).</span></p><p class="c26"><span class="c5 c4">When the Whoopie Defining Card is a joker then the first card led by the player on dealer&#39;s left will define the first trump suit and the denomination of Whoopie cards for the remainder of the Stanza. If the player leads the other joker, he automatically wins the trick (other players may discard any card from their hand), and the second card he leads defines the trump suit and Whoopie card denomination. A player playing a joker should say &quot;Scramble!&rdquo; &nbsp;However, there is no penalty for not doing this.</span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c5 c13"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c5 c9"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c10"><span class="c5 c9"></span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c5 c9">Section II - Special Procedures</span></p><p class="c23 c20"><span class="c5 c4"></span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c4 c7">Played Cards</span><span class="c5 c4">: A card is played when it touches the table face up, or when it has intentionally been detached by the player from his hand in such a manner that two or more of the other players are able to identify it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c7">Cards played out of turn</span><span class="c4">:</span><span class="c5 c4">&nbsp;A lead or play out of turn is improper and is not condoned by subsequent play. All such incorrectly played cards become Penalty Cards (this specifically includes any cards played after the first in correct card). The play reverts to the player whose turn it was to lead or play.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c7">Improperly exposed cards</span><span class="c4">: </span><span class="c5 c4">If a player, intentionally or accidentally, improperly plays one or more cards from his hand, all such cards become penalty cards; if he simultaneously plays two or more cards when it is his turn to play to a trick, he may designate the one he meant to play; the others become penalty cards (the higher ranking cards become the oldest penalty cards within this group; among equally ranked cards by denomination spades rank as oldest, then hearts, diamonds, and clubs (youngest) and a joker ranks above an ace regardless of the Whoopie card).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c7">Penalty Cards</span><span class="c5 c4">: A penalty card must be played by the player at his first legal opportunity - either in leading or following suit or as his first discard when unable to follow suit or when a joker is led. A penalty card remains face up in front of the player until played. A new penalty card becomes the youngest penalty card. A card played incorrectly (when an older penalty card should have been played) becomes a new (youngest) penalty card. When a player has several penalty cards the oldest legally playable penalty card must be played.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c7">Misdeals</span><span class="c5 c4">: A misdeal requires a redeal by the correct dealer; the deal does not pass on a misdeal. A misdeal occurs if:</span></p><ol class="c3 lst-kix_yz36t5t2vqfk-0 start" start="1"><li class="c1 c18"><span class="c5 c4">Any player&#39;s card is exposed during the deal. </span></li><li class="c1 c18"><span class="c5 c4">Any card in the undealt stack is exposed, other than the Whoopie Defining Card. </span></li><li class="c1 c18"><span class="c5 c4">If before the bidding is finished it is determined that the dealer was not the correct dealer, in which case the proper dealer shall deal. </span></li><li class="c1 c18"><span class="c5 c4">If before the bidding is finished it is determined that an incorrect number of cards was dealt to any player.</span></li></ol><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c7">Incorrect number of cards</span><span class="c5 c4">: If after the bidding is finished a player discovers he has too many or too few cards, he plays out the hand with those he has; if he was dealt too few cards and wins a trick with his last card, the lead passes to the first player at his left who has a remaining card.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c7">Bids out of turn</span><span class="c5 c4">: A bid out of turn stands, but the bidding reverts to the player whose turn it was to bid. If the bid out of turn was for any number other than zero, the player bidding out of turn loses one point from his score. Exception: if dealer bids out of turn, his call is void, he loses one point from his score, and the bidding reverts to the correct bidder.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c7">Changing bids</span><span class="c5 c4">: A player may change his bid only if he does so in the same breath. Otherwise the change is void and the original bid, if legal, stands. A bid for more than the possible number of tricks is illegal and the player must substitute a legal bid.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c7">Revokes</span><span class="c5 c4">: Failure to follow suit when able to constitutes a revoke by a player.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c4">If the mistake is discovered before another player has played a card to the next trick, and if the cards played to the revoke trick can be separated and returned to the players who played them after the revoke occurred, then this is done and the revoke is corrected; the offender&#39;s incorrectly played card becomes a penalty card, but those of the non-offending players do not. Players playing after the corrected revoke may, if legally able to, change the card they played. The offender loses one point from his score.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c4">In all other cases the revoke trick stands as played. If the offender first calls attention to his error, he loses one point from his score and in -addition is deemed to have failed in his bid, regardless of the actual number of tricks he took. If attention is first called to this error by any other player, the offender loses 4 points from his score, and fails in his bid. There is no penalty for a revoke if it is not discovered until after the bidding for the next stanza has started.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c7">Adding new players</span><span class="c5 c4">: New players may be added at the start of any stanza; local rules may impose additional requirements for a proper entering procedure. The new player enters with a score which is the truncated average of the preceding stanza.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c7">Truncated average for a stanza</span><span class="c5 c4">: This is obtained by adding together the scores of the players who participated in the stanza, dividing by the number of players, discarding the positive remainder, and taking the quotient result, e.g. Suppose 5 players whose sum of scores = 54; average = 54/5 s 10.8; truncated average (discarding the remainder) = 10.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c7">Re-entering players</span><span class="c5 c4">: If a player re-enters the same game he left earlier, or a related one, after missing one or more hands, he re-enters with his former score.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c7">Extrapolation</span><span class="c5 c4">: Under certain circumstances, as authorized in sanctioned games by the Acting Executor, and in other games by local custom, an extrapolation procedure may be applied to a player&#39;s score when the player leaves the game-before it is finished. This adjustment, done at the end of the game, enables the absent player to participate more equitably in the final standings.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c4">Procedure: the difference between the truncated average of the last stanza the player participated in (STA) and the final truncated average (FTA) is added to the players score to give him an extrapolated final score. If the difference (FTA - STA) is negative no adjustment is made to the player&#39;s final score.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c4">The final truncated average is determined by taking the final scores of players participating in the last three stanzas, averaging, and truncating the result.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c7">Splitting a game</span><span class="c5 c4">: If ten or more players wish to participate in a particular game and it is decided to divide an existing parent game into several off-spring games, then the present and potential players are ranked on the basis of their scores in the last stanza (potential players are assigned the truncated average of the last stanza). Players tied for a particular position draw cards to break such ties.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c4">If the game is to be split into two groups the highest ranking player is placed in group A, the second highest in group B, third highest in group A, fourth highest in group B, etc. An analogous selection procedure holds if the parent game is to be split into three, four, ... off-spring games.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c4">Players retain their former scores, and draw cards to determine the first dealer and scorekeeper in each group (including the parent group). The number of cards dealt in the first hand for each group is the same as the number that would have been dealt in the parent game, and the direction is the same, i.e. an increasing or decreasing number of cards is being dealt.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c4">Additional new players may enter either the parent or an offspring game; additional splitting may occur and a derived off-spring game may become a generating parent. In sanctioned games the number of player-hands up to the split carries over from the generating parent to each off-spring.</span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c5 c4"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c2 c20"><span class="c5 c9"></span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c5 c9">Section III - Violations of the Spirit of Whoopie</span></p><p class="c2 c20 c24"><span class="c5 c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c4">The following actions are disruptive in a sanctioned game and violate the spirit of Whoopie.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c7">Improper Information</span><span class="c4">:</span><span class="c5 c4">&nbsp;If a player intentionally looks at another player&#39;s closed hand or intentionally exposes cards from his own closed hand, the player is guilty of a type 1 violation.

A participating player may appeal an interpretation or ruling by the Acting Executor of the game. The appeal may be carried to an Associate Executor, further appealed to the Managing Executor, and finally to the College of Executors (who may also impose disciplinary penalties if the appeal is judged to be without merit).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c4">The point awards depend on the sanction level and type of the game. Present levels include: restricted, open, special event, and series playoff- consolation. In appropriate circumstances individual sanctions may be obtained upon payment of proper fees. Certain events (generally the more difficult ones) award blue points.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c4">The following degrees of proficiency in Whoopie have been recognized:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c7">Novice of Whoopie</span><span class="c5 c4">: A player who has participated in any sanctioned game.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c7">Junior Master of Whoopie</span><span class="c5 c4">: A player who has registered at least 1 Whoopie Rating Point.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c7">Master of Whoopie</span><span class="c5 c4">: A player who has registered at least 25 Whoopie Rating Points, including at least 2 blue points.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c7">Senior Master of Whoopee</span><span class="c5 c4">: A player who has registered at least 100 Whoopie Rating Points including at least 10 blue points.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c7">Grand Master of Whoopie</span><span class="c4">:</span><span class="c5 c4">&nbsp;A player who has registered at least 500 Whoopie Rating points including at least 75 blue points.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c7">Champion of Whoopie</span><span class="c5 c4">: A player who has registered at least 1000 Whoopie Rating Points including at least 200 blue points.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Unmutilated Rating Point Certificates may be recorded with SAAS.
