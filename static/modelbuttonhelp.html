<H1>Explanation of Three Modeling Buttons</H1>

<H3>Show Initial Cap Table</H3>
This button models the cap table prior to any seed investments in convertibles. In other words, this
will show the initial ownership of the founders and any other current common stock holders.

<H3>Show Cap Table Pre Equity</H3>
This button models the cap table as if all convertibles (safes and notes) would be converted to
equity prior to an additional equity round. Any equity information entered is
ignored. If the number
of fully diluted pre-money shares cannot be calculated from founder equity and options you will be asked for it.

<p></p>
The idea is that this immediately gives founders and investors a pretty good idea of the
dilution represented by money raised on converts.
<p></p>
Angelcalc (somewhat randomly) chooses a conversion valuation of twice the largest cap.

<H3>Show Cap Table Post Equity</H3>
This button models what the cap table will look like given the equity round entered. All convertibles are converted
just prior to that equity round. To be clear, this means that the equity holder will not be diluted by any of the
convertibles.
